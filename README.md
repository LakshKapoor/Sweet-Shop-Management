#Sweet Shop Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a backend-first implementation of a Sweet Shop Management System.
It allows users to register, authenticate, and manage sweets inventory.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate backend fundamentals, REST APIs,
test-driven development, and clean version control practices, using test-driven
development (TDD)


## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: Planned (PostgreSQL / SQLite)
- Testing: Jest, Supertest (planned)
- Authentication: JWT (planned)
- Frontend: React (planned)

- Add, update, delete sweets (admin)
- Purchase and restock sweets
- Search and filter sweets

## Current Status
- Express backend initialized
- Health check endpoint implemented

## Installation
- Clone repo  
- Navigate to backend:
    - ```bash
    cd backend
- npm install

## Testing
- Run `npx jest` to run all tests
- Tests include:
